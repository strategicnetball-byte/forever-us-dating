## Recommendations to Optimize Economics

### 1. **Adjust Points to Encourage Engagement**

**Current Issue**: Video ads have poor ROI for users
- Users need 7 video ads to send 1 message (3.5 min)
- This creates friction

**Recommendation**:
```
Video Ads: Increase from 15-20 → 25-30 points
- Makes 4 videos = 1 message (2 min) - more reasonable
- Slightly reduces your per-view revenue but increases engagement
- Users watch more ads when ROI is better
```

### 2. **Implement Daily Limits to Encourage Subscriptions**

**Current Issue**: Free users can earn unlimited points
- No incentive to upgrade

**Recommendation**:
```
Free Tier:
- Daily earning limit: 50 points/day
- Can earn from: 1 video ad + 1 survey OR 1 offer
- After limit: "Upgrade to Premium for unlimited earning"

Premium Tier:
- Daily earning limit: 150 points/day
- Can earn from: All activities

VIP Tier:
- No daily limit
- 2x points on all activities
```

### 3. **Tiered Offer Availability**

**Current Issue**: All users see same offers
- No incentive to upgrade

**Recommendation**:
```
Free Tier:
- 2 offers/day available
- 50 points per offer

Premium Tier:
- 5 offers/day available
- 75 points per offer

VIP Tier:
- Unlimited offers
- 100 points per offer
```

### 4. **Subscription Bonus Structure**

**Current**: 100 pts (Premium), 200 pts (VIP) one-time
**Recommendation**:
```
Premium ($5/month):
- 100 bonus points on signup
- 25 bonus points every 7 days (loyalty)
- 2x points on surveys

VIP ($10/month):
- 200 bonus points on signup
- 50 bonus points every 7 days (loyalty)
- 2x points on all activities
- Early access to new offers
```

### 5. **Referral Program**

**Add incentive for user growth**:
```
Referral Rewards:
- Refer friend: Both get 50 points
- Friend upgrades to Premium: You get $1 credit
- Friend upgrades to VIP: You get $2 credit
```
